Hollo changelog
===============

Version 0.7.0
-------------

To be released.

 -  Fixed `POST /api/v1/statuses` and `PUT /api/v1/statuses/:id` endpoints
    rejecting FormData requests.  These endpoints now properly accept both
    JSON and FormData content types, improving compatibility with Mastodon
    clients that send `multipart/form-data` requests.
    [[#170], [#171] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Fixed a bug where multiple JSON objects were written on a single line
    in log files when `LOG_FILE` environment variable was set.  Upgraded
    LogTape to 1.0 and now uses `jsonLinesFormatter` to ensure proper
    JSON Lines format with one JSON object per line.  [[#174]]

Version 0.6.5
-------------

Released on Juily 17, 2025.

 -  Fixed an HTML injection vulnerability where form elements, scripts, and
    other potentially dangerous HTML tags in federated posts were not properly
    sanitized before rendering.  This could allow malicious actors to inject
    forms for phishing, execute JavaScript, or perform CSRF attacks.
    The fix implements strict HTML sanitization using an allowlist approach
    to ensure only safe HTML elements and attributes are rendered.
    [[CVE-2025-53941]]

[CVE-2025-53941]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/security/advisories/GHSA-w7gc-g3x7-hq8h


Version 0.6.4
-------------

Released on July 7, 2025.

 -  Fixed a regression bug where follower-only posts were returning `404 Not
    Found` errors when accessed through conversation threads. This was caused
    by improper OAuth scope checking that only accepted `read:statuses` scope
    but tokens contain `read` scope:  [[#169], [#172]]

     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id`
     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/context`

[#172]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/172


Version 0.6.3
-------------

Released on June 23, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where remote posts mentioning the same user multiple times
    could not be retrieved due to database constraint violations.


Version 0.6.2
-------------

Released on June 8, 2025.

 -  Fixed an issue where Hollo 0.6.x installations upgraded from Hollo 0.5.x
    or earlier failed to sign in with Elk, a popular Mastodon client.
    This was caused by old application registrations incorrectly defaulting
    to non-confidential.  All existing applications are now properly set as
    confidential clients.  [[#167], [#168] by Emelia Smith]

[#168]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/168


Version 0.6.1
-------------

Released on June 5, 2025.

 -  Fixed `POST /oauth/token` endpoint rejecting requests with additional
    parameters not required by RFC 6749 but commonly sent by clients.
    The endpoint now gracefully ignores extra parameters like `scope` in
    `authorization_code` requests and `redirect_uri` in `client_credentials`
    requests instead of returning validation errors.

Version 0.6.0
-------------

Released on June 5, 2025.

 -  Revamped the environment variables for asset storage configuration.
    [[#115], [#121] by Emelia Smith]

     -  Added `FS_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable, which is required where
        `DRIVE_DISK` is set to `fs`.
     -  Added `STORAGE_URL_BASE` environment variable, which is required.
     -  Deprecated `FS_ASSET_PATH` in favor of `FS_STORAGE_PATH`.
     -  Deprecated `ASSET_URL_BASE` in favor of `STORAGE_URL_BASE`.

 -  Implemented OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with support for access grants.
    This improves the security of the OAuth authorization process by separating
    the authorization code from the access token issuance.
    [[#130] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Hollo now requires the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to be at least 44
    characters long.  This change ensures sufficient entropy for cryptographic
    operations.  [[#126] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Hollo now lets */.well-known/* and */oauth/* endpoints allow cross origin
    requests which is aligned with those of Mastodon.  [[#126] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Added the `BIND` environment variable to specify the host address to
    listen on.  [[#114], [#120] by Emelia Smith]

 -  The theme color of the profile page is now customizable.  The list of all
    available theme colors can be found in the [*Colors* section] of the Pico
    CSS docs.

 -  You can now sign out from the administration dashboard.
    [[#50], [#122] by Emelia Smith]

 -  On profile page, shared posts are now more visually separated from the
    original posts, and the time of sharing is now shown.  [[#111]]

 -  On profile page, alt texts for images are now expanded within `<details>`.
    [[#99], [#110] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  The `scope` parameter is now optional for `POST /oauth/token` endpoint.

 -  The current version string is displayed at the bottom of the dashboard page.
    [[#136], [#137] by RangHo Lee]

 -  Increased the maximum character limit for posts from 4,096 to 10,000
    characters.

 -  EXIF metadata of attached images are now stripped before storing them
    to prevent privacy leaks.  [[#152] by NTSK]

 -  Code blocks inside Markdown are now highlighted.  The syntax highlighting is
    powered By [Shiki].  See also the [complete list of supported languages].
    [[#149]]

 -  Implemented OAuth 2.0 Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) support with the
    `S256` code challenge method.  This enhances security by preventing
    authorization code interception attacks in the OAuth authorization flow.
    [[#155] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Added support for the `profile` OAuth scope for enhanced user authentication.
    This allows applications to request limited profile information using the
    new `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint and enables the `profile` scope to be used
    with the `GET /api/v1/accounts/verify_credentials` endpoint.
    [[#45], [#156] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Made few Mastodon API endpoints publicly accessible without
    authentication so that they behave more similarly to Mastodon:

     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id`
     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/context`

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.5.3 and *@fedify/postgres* to 0.3.0.

 -  The minimum required version of Node.js is now 24.0.0.

[#142]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/142

-------------

Released on February 26, 2025.

    rendered correctly from other software including Mitra.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.4.4.


Version 0.5.3
-------------

Released on February 22, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where when an account profile had been updated, the `Update`
    activity had been made with no `assertionMethods` field, which had caused
    interoperability issues with Mitra.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.4.3.


Version 0.5.2
-------------

Released on February 20, 2025.

-  Fixed a bug where the `follows.follower_id` column had not referenced the
    `accounts.id` column.  [[#112]]

 -  Fixed a bug where `GET /api/v1/notifications` had returned server errors
    with some filters.  [[#113]]

 -  Fixed a bug where the federation dashboard had not shown due to server
    errors when an instance had just been set up.

Version 0.5.1
-------------

Released on February 14, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `GET /api/v1/accounts/:id/statuses` had tried to fetch
    remote posts for local accounts.  [[#107]]


Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on February 12, 2025.

 -  The number of shares and likes became more accurate.

     -  The `Note` objects now have `shares` and `likes` collections with
        their `totalItems` numbers.
     -  When a remote `Note` is persisted, now the `totalItems` numbers of
        `shares` and `likes` are also persisted.
     -  When a `Announce(Note)` or `Undo(Announce(Note))` activity is received,
        now it is forwarded to the followers as well if the activity is signed.

 -  Added [`GET /api/v1/mutes`] API to Mastodon comapatiblity layer.  This API
    returns a list of accounts that are muted by the authenticated user.
    [[#103]]

 -  Added [`GET /api/v1/blocks`] API to Mastodon comapatiblity layer.  This API
    returns a list of accounts that are blocked by the authenticated user.
    [[#103]]

    size was reduced when there were many custom fields on profile page.
    [[#106] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  Added `ALLOW_HTML` environment variable to allow raw HTML inside Markdown.
    This is useful for allowing users to use broader formatting options outside
    of Markdown, but to avoid XSS attacks, it is still limited to a subset of
    HTML tags and attributes.

 -  On profile page, the favicon is now switched between light and dark mode
    according to the user's preference.  [[#101]]

 -  The `S3_REGION` environment variable became required if `DRIVE_DISK` is set
    to `s3`.  [[#95]]

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on December 30, 2024.

 -  Hollo is now powered by Node.js 23+ instead of Bun for more efficient
    memory usage.

 -  Added an experimental feature flag `TIMELINE_INBOXES` to store all posts
    visible to your timeline in the database, rather than filtering them
    in real-time as they are displayed.  This is useful for relatively
    larger instances with many incoming posts, but as of now it may have
    several bugs.  It is expected to be the default behavior in the future
    after it is stabilized.

 -  Now you can import and export your data from the administration dashboard
    in CSV format: follows, lists, accounts you muted, accounts you blocked,
    and bookmarks.

 -  You can now make your profile [`discoverable`].

 -  The profile page now shows a user's cover image if they have one.

 -  Added `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/reblogged_by` API to Mastodon comapatiblity
    layer.  This API returns a list of accounts that have shared a post.

 -  Fixed a bug where a server error occurred when an invalid UUID was input via
    URL or form data.  [[#65]]

 -  Fixed a bug where the same post could be shared multiple times by the same
    account.

 -  Added `LOG_FILE` environment variable to specify the file path to write
    structured logs.  The logs are written in JSON Lines format.

 -  Improved the performance of recipients gathering during sending activities.

 -  For the sake of concision, now log sink for Sentry is removed.

Released on October 30, 2024.

 -  Fixed a bug where followers-only posts from accounts that had had set
    their follower lists to private had been recognized as direct messages.
    Even after upgrading to this version, such accounts need to be force-refreshed
    from the administration dashboard to fix the issue.

 -  Fixed the federated (public) timeline showing the shared posts from
    the blocked or muted accounts.

 -  Fixed the list timeline showing the shared posts from the blocked or muted
    accounts.

    accounts.


Version 0.1.3
-------------

Released on October 27, 2024.

    `rel=alternate`.  This caused inoperability with some software such as
    GoToSocial.
 -  It now sends `Delete(Person)` activity to followees besides followers
    when a user deletes their account.


Version 0.1.2
-------------

Released on October 24, 2024.
